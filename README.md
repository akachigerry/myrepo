   Calculates frnome-wide modal depth for aligned sequence data in pileup format

2. extract_parents_vcf.cc

   Extracts variant data for specific genome regions in specific individuals from large variant data

3. random_dnaSeq.cc 

   Generates 3 random sequences in fasta format from a single late fasta file input
